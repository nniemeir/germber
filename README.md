# GERMBER

A GameBoy emulation project using Low Level Devel's as a starting point. I am mostly doing this to get an idea of how processors really work, so I have not decided if I will add functionality beyond CPU emulation.

## Dependencies
* GCC
* GNU make

## Installation
Compile the project
```
make
```
Install the compiled binary
```
sudo make install
```

### Make Targets
